// ## Typescript Declaration File

// -> In TypeScript, .d.ts files, also known as declaration files , consist of type definitions, and are used to provide types for javascript code.
//    They allow TypeScript to understand the shape and types of objects, funcitons, classes , etc.,
//    in JavaScript libraries, enabling type checking and autocompletion in TypeScript code that uses these libraries.
